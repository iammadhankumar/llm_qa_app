# How it works 

Clone the GitHub Repository :
First, you need to clone the GitHub repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
git clone https://github.com/iammadhankumar/llm_qa_app.git

Install Required Dependencies:
Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and install the required dependencies by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Get your OpenAI API Key:
You'll need an API key from OpenAI to use their language model. If you haven't already, sign up for an OpenAI account and obtain your API key. This key is required for authenticating your requests to the OpenAI API.

Run the Streamlit App:
Once you have the API key, you can run the Streamlit app. Streamlit is a Python library used for creating interactive web apps for data science and machine learning projects. In this case, it's being used to create a user interface for interacting with the language model.

Run the following command in your terminal :
streamlit run chat.py

This command will start the Streamlit app, and you should be able to access it through your web browser.
With these steps completed, you should have the project up and running, allowing you to interact with the OpenAI Language Model through the Streamlit interface.
